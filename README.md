🤖 AI Message Input Component

This project demonstrates a simple message input component with an integrated AI response modal. It simulates a messaging interface where users can type a message, generate an AI response, and insert the response into the message field. This project showcases my ability to implement React with TypeScript, manage state, and handle user interactions.

Features
✍️ Message Input Field: A user can type a message into a textarea.
🧠 AI Icon: Once the input is focused, an AI icon appears, allowing the user to trigger a modal.
📥 Modal: When the AI icon is clicked, a modal opens where the user can enter a command for the AI to generate a response.
⏳ Response Generation: After entering a command, a dummy AI response is generated and displayed after a delay, simulating an asynchronous API response.
➕ Insert Response: The generated AI response can be inserted back into the message input field via the modal.
💬 Message Display: Both user messages and AI-generated responses are displayed in the UI as chat bubbles.

Key Components:
MessageInput Component:
Contains the textarea where the user types a message.
Displays an AI icon once the textarea is focused.
Opens a modal when the AI icon is clicked.
Manages the state of messages, the modal, and generated responses.
Displays both user and AI messages in a chat-style interface.
Modal Component:
A popup modal where users can type a command for the AI to generate a response.
Includes buttons to generate a response and insert it back into the main message input field.
Allows closing the modal without generating a response.
Technologies Used
⚛️ React: Core library for building the UI.
🔷 TypeScript: Strongly typed language used to build the component logic.
🎨 TailwindCSS: Basic styling for components.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of React for building an interactive UI where users can type messages, generate AI responses, and insert them into the chat. It showcases key React skills such as state management, component structure, and event handling. 🎉
